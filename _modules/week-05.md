: Building Dapp: From Design to Deployment<br>
  Instructor: <a href="/kaist/staff/#Jaesun Han (Jason)">Jason Han</a><br>
  Abstract: This lecture covers the entire process for developing a dapp. We'll cover a seven-step process, starting with design, followed by smart contract development, web app development, phased deployment and testing to different environments (local, testnet, mainnet).

<b>Lecture 10</b>
: Building Dapp: Under the hood<br>
  Instructor: <a href="/kaist/staff/#Jaesun Han (Jason)">Jason Han</a><br>
  Abstract: In this lesson, you will learn how to create a Token Dapp using hardhat and ethers.js. You will follow the seven steps learned in the previous lesson to develop, deploy, and test it. We'll also take a closer look at ethers.js, an ethereum javascript library that is essential for web app development. Finally, we'll cover the principles of how web apps and contracts work by sending and receiving transactions. Here, you'll learn how bytecode, ABI, JSON-RPC, transactions, and more work.<br>
