<b>Lecture 26</b>
: Closing lecture<br>
  Instructor: <a href="/kaist/staff/#Jaesun Han (Jason)">Jason Han</a><br>
  Abstract: This lecture reviews the on-chain governance during the project submission and evaluation. The on-chain governance and motivation design changed how students engage in the class. It's a community-driven decision making, which is a new kind of problem solving. Then, I'll address why I started this class as a community-driven learning. Lastly, I'll show the possible next step in your Web3 journey. After the class, we'll have time for networking.<br>
