  Abstract: What distinguishes traditional Web2 Games from Web3 Games? What problems on traditional games we can solve with web3? In this session, we will delve into the paradigm of Web3 gaming. We’ll be sharing a historical perspective on the evolution of game types based on my real-world experiences in the gaming industry. Following that, we’ll explore the future of ‘Play and Own’. We will have an in-depth look at numerous Web3 games and discuss the perspectives we should adopt when approaching these types of games in the future.<br>

<b>Lecture 22</b>
: DAOs: The what, why, and how<br>
  Guest Speaker: <a href="/kaist/speaker/#Dr. Rolf Lorenz Hoefer">Dr. Rolf Lorenz Hoefer</a> (Serial DAOist, Founding and Managing Partner @ Cultur3, MetaCartel Ventures DAO, Metarial VC)<br>
  Abstract: DAOs can fundamentally alter the way we organize to deliver products and services. Many people are confused what DAOs are, and what they are not. We define DAOs, and from this definition will dive into the major logics driving when, why, and how DAOs will success or fail. We will go through a number of examples, as well as get an understanding of what the latest thinking and trends in the space are, including opportunities to contribute to the DAO space.<br>
