Eric is a product manager at Sendbird, powering scalable chat/voice/video API for individuals and organizations to implement in-app digital connections quickly. His current interest is to build a product that allows users to recognize meaningful/loyal digital connections by providing one-click data integration with a pre-build analytics template to their existing data analytics tool. He constantly challenges himself to validate the value of blockchain technology's interoperability. He feels grateful for the opportunity to be part of exciting journeys as an angel investor at companies like oopy, bugcity, and story protocol. He enjoys finding cool web3 projects that focus on delivering real values to human society.
