I previously worked for Samsung research as SW engineer for 14 years. I focused on researching security and privacy. In 2016, I led in-house venture project called "Blockchain-based marketplace for personal data on mobile". People can sell their data on mobile such as location data or app usage to marketing companies using the p2p network to make pocket money. In 2019, I founded zero knowledge (zk) proof research community called ZK-SEL. What ZK-SEL does is to take sponsorship from zk-based projects such as Starkware, Polygon ZK and Anoma and research their technical details and translate into Korean so the audience here can understand what the projects are about in technical aspect. December '21, I found a project called Radius, MEV-resistant sequencing layer for rollups on Ethereum. The layer minimizes harmful MEV such as front running and sandwich attack using cryptography including zkp and encryption, also maximizes benign MEV for example arbitrage and liquidation. (also support for cross-rollup arbitrage)
