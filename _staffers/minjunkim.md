As an aspiring student devoted to blockchain and entrepreneurship, MinJun has persisted in learning and evolving as an entrepreneur. MinJun used to be an undergraduate student at KAIST double majoring in BTM (Business & Technology Management) and Computer Science. After finishing his second year, MinJun has taken years off to explore start-up and Web3. MinJun co-founded a NFT-focused company–SOONI Labs–under the mission of bridging the gap between NFTs and real world utility via practical DApp extensions. He carried out SOONI (mobile metaverse designated for public transport), WeBe (NFT community) and BetterWorld (social DApp designated for NFTs) since 2021. Consequently, MinJun co-estblished Orakle–the foremost blockchain research society at KAIST. He is currently working at Pi-Lab (BIFROSRT) as an industrial technical personnel while pursuing the mission of Orakle as a president.
